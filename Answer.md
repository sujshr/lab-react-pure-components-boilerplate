React's pure components implement a 'shouldComponentUpdate' method with a shallow comparison of props and state. It retruns false if the props or state are same. Unless the props or state of a pure component have changed, React prevents unnecessary re-renders. Regular components re-render whenever their parent component re-renders even if the props or state haven't changed. The 'shouldComponentUpdate' method returns true by default in case of regulat components.
